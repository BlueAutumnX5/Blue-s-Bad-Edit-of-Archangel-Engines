#About this Abomination
So I was checking my farm and discovered an old truck that half submerged to the river. I opened the hood and saw a Detroit Diesel 8v149 inside. Well, that is precious nowdays but I already have Detroit 12v92, 12v149 in my truck, and 20v149 as my generator. So I decided to cut one cylinder off the 8v149 and make as a test engine. using gasoline and an aftermarket top end. The aftermarket top end is a little bit tight and made the compression to 12:1. And then I tweak it untill it can drive my old Fiat 126p. The other 7 cylinders left will be used as my future (I hope it will be more successful & good) project.
