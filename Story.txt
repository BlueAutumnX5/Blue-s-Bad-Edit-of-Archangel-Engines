Let me tell you something. This is the forst time i use Git Bash, Visual Studio Code, and the first time pushing something from local to Github. The initial commit takes me almost 4 hours. And the first time i'm confused why it did not want to pull because of the rejected push. now i know the basics of pull and push. Time to sleep now. it's 1 AM when I'm done the "Initial Commit".
