Information:

LTSP#4 Features yet another complete revamp of cylinder head flow calculations. Your experience should get a lot more realistic and pleasant.
On top of this major change, there are some minor changes to intakes, exhausts, and cylinder heads.
As a nice bonus, fuel and dynamometer settings were made easily accessible.
If you want to know the details - ask Archangel Motors directly;

There is guide for adjusting Seat-to-seat/0.050 duration compensation parameter in the "Extras" folder;

All engines are shipped in an untuned condition. User action is required for a successful start-up and run;
Every engine features easy adjustments for most of the key parameters;
A lot of components feature automated calculations, but they can be overridden if needed.


FAQ:

Q: Why doesn't my engine start and idle?
A: Engines are shipped with throttle body closed. Please adjust the idle throttle plate position and idle fueling if necessary.

Q: Why do some of my engines misfire right out of the box?
A: Twin-Firing engines may experience misfires due to distributor limitations. Applying the ignition advance fixes the problem.

Q: Why is my engine underpowered?
A: Engines are shipped in an untuned condition. Please tune the components according to your needs.

Q: Why does my engine break?
A: It is very rare, but there is a possibility of extreme engines breaking down for seemingly no reason. Applying failsafe parts from the "Extras" folder should fix them. In case they do not - contact Archangel Motors.

Q: I do not understand something. Whom do I consult?
A: Ask Archangel Motors directly.
